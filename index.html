                    An Android mobile application developed to supplement Chi Heng Foundation's first Nursing Care Assistant Course offering in Zheng Zhou, China. This application
                    allows students to review selected topics discussed in class, and can also serve as a quick-reference guide to help students recognize clients' health conditions
                    during clinical practice. The application was distributed to students via APK download in July.<br><br>

                            A 4-phase Java class project completed for CPSC210 (Software construction course). To-do tasks and projects (a group of tasks) can be created, deleted, and modified and are stored in JSON format.
                            Each task is parsed into JSON object and has features including title, description, due-date, priority, and tags. GUIs are implemented with JavaFX. 
                            Composite design pattern is used so that features such as progress and time to completion can be modified and calculated for both projects and tasks. For each phase, JUnit tests
                            are used to comprehensively test the functionality of the project.
